## Fun Facts:
```yaml
fact_1: As a Peruvian-American, I can't help but feel a little biased,
        but I have to say, Peruvian food is my favorite!

fact_2: I absolutely love the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy.
        Each film always has an incredible soundtrack, stunning visuals, and a fun storyline.
        They remind me of when my older sister first introduced me to Marvel!

fact_3: I enjoy creating 3D paper crafts, especially paper theaters.
        There are so many fun themes to choose from,
        but my favorites are inspired by Studio Ghibli films.
